# American Express Hack 

*The American Express Challenge 2020* is presented by [UCL Data Science](https://www.ucldss.co.uk/). Teams have three weeks to devise a FinTech solution to support American Express' business. At the end of the three weeks, a winner with the best business and technical proposal will be announced. Our hackathon submission is centred on American Express' partnerships with small businesses, and is running for the best UI design. 

The code in this repository is to help American Express support small business. We have achieved this through two means:

* A questionnaire to help small business owners find the correct American Express card for their business 
* A *Jargon Buster* page to explain unfamiliar terms to the user 

Our hope is that small business owners will be able to better assess which American Express card their company should use, and for the user to fully understand the financial benefits of such a card.  

This project has been created by Julia Enright, Karen Trippler, and Iona Carslaw.
